# United States crime map

An interactive web application to depict different crimes in the United States from 1960 to 2014. The app uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [mappa](https://mappa.js.org/docs/tldr-p5.html) libraries to visualise data.

The game is deployed [here](https://khholst.github.io/US-crime-map/)
